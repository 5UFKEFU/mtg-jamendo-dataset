## Structure

### Metadata files in `data`

Pre-processing
- `raw.tsv` (56639) - raw file without postprocessing
- `raw_30s.tsv`(55701) - tracks with duration more than 30s
- `raw_30s_cleantags.tsv`(55701) - with tags merged according to `tag_map.json`
- `raw_30s_cleantags_50artists.tsv`(55609) - with tags that have at least 50 unique artists
- `tag_map.json` - map of tags that we merged
- `autotagging.tsv` = `raw_30sec_cleantags_50artists.tsv` - base file for autotagging (after all postprocessing)

Subsets
- `autotagging_top50tags.tsv` (54380) - only top 50 tags according to tag frequency in terms of tracks
- `autotagging_moodtheme.tsv` (18486) - only tracks with mood/theme tags, and only those tags

Splits
- `splits` folder contains training/validation/testing sets for `autotagging.tsv` and subsets

Note: by removing artist effect and ensuring that splits work for all subsets, number of tags and tracks have 
been discarded


### Statistics in `stats`

Statistics of number of tracks, albums and artists per tag sorted by artists
Each directory has statistics for metadata file with the same name

## Using the dataset

### Requirements

* Python 3.6
* Virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv`
* Create virtual environment and install requirements
```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

### Loading data in python
Assuming you are working in `scripts` folder
```python
import commons

input_file = '../data/autotagging.tsv'
tracks, tags, extra = commons.read_file(input_file)
```
`tracks` is a dictionary with `track_id` as key and track data as value:
```python
{
    1376256: {
    'artist_id': 490499,
    'album_id': 161779,
    'path': '56/1376256.mp3',
    'duration': 166.0,
    'tags': [
        'genre---easylistening',
        'genre---downtempo',
        'genre---chillout',
        'mood/theme---commercial',
        'mood/theme---corporate',
        'instrument---piano'
        ],
    'genre': {'chillout', 'downtempo', 'easylistening'},
    'mood/theme': {'commercial', 'corporate'},
    'instrument': {'piano'}
    }
    ...
}
```
`tags` contains mapping of tags to `track_id`:
```python
{
    'genre': {
        'easylistening': {1376256, 1376257, ...},
        'downtempo': {1376256, 1376257, ...},
        ...
    },
    'mood/theme': {...},
    'instrument': {...}
}
```
`extra` has information that is useful to format output file, so pass it to `write_file` if you are using it, otherwise you can just ignore it

### Reproduce postprocessing & statistics

* Compute statistics
```bash
python scripts/statistics.py data/raw.tsv stats/raw
python scripts/statistics.py data/raw_30s.tsv stats/raw_30s
```

* Clean tags and recompute statistics
```bash
python scripts/clean_tags.py data/raw_30s.tsv data/tag_map.json data/raw_30s_cleantags.tsv
python scripts/statistics.py data/raw_30s_cleantags.tsv stats/raw_30s_cleantags
```

* Filter out tags with low number of unique artists and recompute statistics
```bash
python scripts/filter_fewartists.py data/raw_30s_cleantags.tsv 50 data/raw_30s_cleantags_50artists.tsv --stats-directory stats/raw_30s_cleantags_50artists
```

* `autotagging` file in `data` and folder in `stats` is a symbolic link to `raw_30s_cleantags_50artists`

* Visualize top 20 tags per category
```bash
python scripts/visualize_tags stats/autotagging 20  # generates top20.pdf figure
```

### Subsets
* Create subset with only top50 tags by number of tracks
```bash
python scripts/filter_toptags.py data/autotagging.tsv 50 data/autotagging_top50tags.tsv --stats-directory stats/autotagging_top50tags
```

* Create subset with only mood/theme tags
```bash
python scripts/filter_category data/autotagging.tsv mood/theme data/autotagging_moodtheme.tsv
```
