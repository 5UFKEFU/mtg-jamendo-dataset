# The MTG-Jamendo Dataset

We present the MTG-Jamendo Dataset, a new open dataset for music auto-tagging. It is built using music available at Jamendo under Creative Commons licenses and tags provided by content uploaders. The dataset contains over 55,000 full audio tracks with 195 tags from genre, instrument, and mood/theme categories. We provide elaborated data splits for researchers and report the performance of a simple baseline approach on five different sets of tags: genre, instrument, mood/theme, top-50, and overall.

This repository contains metadata, scripts, instructions on how to download and use the dataset and reproduce baseline results.


## Structure

### Metadata files in `data`

Pre-processing
- `raw.tsv` (56,639) - raw file without postprocessing
- `raw_30s.tsv`(55,701) - tracks with duration more than 30s
- `raw_30s_cleantags.tsv`(55,701) - with tags merged according to `tag_map.json`
- `raw_30s_cleantags_50artists.tsv`(55,609) - with tags that have at least 50 unique artists
- `tag_map.json` - map of tags that we merged
- `tags_top50.txt` - list of top 50 tags
- `autotagging.tsv` = `raw_30sec_cleantags_50artists.tsv` - base file for autotagging (after all postprocessing, 195 tags)

Subsets
- `autotagging_top50tags.tsv` (54,380) - only top 50 tags according to tag frequency in terms of tracks
- `autotagging_genre.tsv` (55,215) - only tracks with genre tags (95 tags), and only those tags
- `autotagging_instrument.tsv` (25,135) - instrument tags (41 tags)
- `autotagging_moodtheme.tsv` (18,486) - mood/theme tags (59 tags)

Splits
- `splits` folder contains training/validation/testing sets for `autotagging.tsv` and subsets

Note: A few tags are discarded in the splits to guarantee the same list of tags across all splits. For `autotagging.tsv`, this results in **55,525 tracks** annotated by **87 genre tags, 40 instrument tags, and 56 mood/theme tags** available in the splits.

Splits are generated from `autotagging.tsv`, containing all tags. For each split, the related subsets (top50, genre, instrument, mood/theme) are built filtering out unrelated tags and tracks without any tags.

### Statistics in `stats`

Statistics of number of tracks, albums and artists per tag sorted by number of artists.
Each directory has statistics for metadata file with the same name.
Statistics for subsets based on categories are not kept seperated due to it already included in `autotagging`

## Using the dataset

### Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* Virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv`
* Create virtual environment and install requirements
```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

Note: on OSX **venv** is recommended to avoid problems with matplotlib ([source](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/faq/osx_framework.html))

### Downloading the data

All audio is distributed in 320kbps MP3 format. In addition we provide precomputed mel-spectrograms which are distributed as NumPy Arrays in NPY format. The audio files and the NPY files are split into folders packed into TAR archives. The dataset is hosted [online at MTG UPF](https://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/datasets/mtg-jamendo/).

We provide the following data subsets:
- `raw_30s/audio` - all available audio for `raw_30s.tsv` (508 GB)
- `raw_30s/melspecs` - mel-spectrograms for `raw_30s.tsv` (229 GB)
- `autotagging-moodtheme/audio` - audio for the mood/theme subset `autotagging_moodtheme.tsv` (152 GB)
- `autotagging-moodtheme/melspecs` - mel-spectrograms for the `autotagging_moodtheme.tsv` subset (68 GB)

For faster downloads, we host a copy of the dataset on Google Drive. We provide a script to download and validate all files in the dataset. See its help message for more information:

```bash
python scripts/download/download.py -h
```
```
usage: download.py [-h] [--dataset {raw_30s,autotagging_moodtheme}]
                   [--type {audio,melspecs}] [--from {gdrive,mtg}] [--unpack]
                   [--remove]
                   outputdir

Download the MTG-Jamendo dataset

positional arguments:
  outputdir             directory to store the dataset

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --dataset {raw_30s,autotagging_moodtheme}
                        dataset to download (default: raw_30s)
  --type {audio,melspecs}
                        type of data to download (audio or mel-spectrograms)
                        (default: audio)
  --from {gdrive,mtg}   download from Google Drive (fast everywhere) or MTG
                        (server in Spain, slow) (default: gdrive)
  --unpack              unpack tar archives (default: False)
  --remove              remove tar archives while unpacking one by one (use to
                        save disk space) (default: False)

```

For example, to download audio for the `autotagging_moodtheme.tsv` subset, unpack and validate all tar archives:

```
mkdir /path/to/download
python3 scripts/download/download.py --dataset autotagging_moodtheme --type audio /path/to/download --unpack --remove
```


Unpacking process is run after tar archive downloads are complete and validated. In the case of download errors, re-run the script to download missing files.

Due to the large size of the dataset, it can be useful to include the `--remove` flag to save disk space: in this case, tar archive are unpacked and immediately removed one by one.


### Loading data in python
Assuming you are working in `scripts` folder
```python
import commons

input_file = '../data/autotagging.tsv'
tracks, tags, extra = commons.read_file(input_file)
```

`tracks` is a dictionary with `track_id` as key and track data as value:
```python
{
    1376256: {
    'artist_id': 490499,
    'album_id': 161779,
    'path': '56/1376256.mp3',
    'duration': 166.0,
    'tags': [
        'genre---easylistening',
        'genre---downtempo',
        'genre---chillout',
        'mood/theme---commercial',
        'mood/theme---corporate',
        'instrument---piano'
        ],
    'genre': {'chillout', 'downtempo', 'easylistening'},
    'mood/theme': {'commercial', 'corporate'},
    'instrument': {'piano'}
    }
    ...
}
```
`tags` contains mapping of tags to `track_id`:
```python
{
    'genre': {
        'easylistening': {1376256, 1376257, ...},
        'downtempo': {1376256, 1376257, ...},
        ...
    },
    'mood/theme': {...},
    'instrument': {...}
}
```
`extra` has information that is useful to format output file, so pass it to `write_file` if you are using it, otherwise you can just ignore it

### Reproduce postprocessing & statistics

* Recompute statistics for `raw` and `raw_30s`
```bash
python scripts/statistics.py data/raw.tsv stats/raw
python scripts/statistics.py data/raw_30s.tsv stats/raw_30s
```

* Clean tags and recompute statistics (`raw_30s_cleantags`)
```bash
python scripts/clean_tags.py data/raw_30s.tsv data/tag_map.json data/raw_30s_cleantags.tsv
python scripts/statistics.py data/raw_30s_cleantags.tsv stats/raw_30s_cleantags
```

* Filter out tags with low number of unique artists and recompute statistics (`raw_30s_cleantags_50artists`)
```bash
python scripts/filter_fewartists.py data/raw_30s_cleantags.tsv 50 data/raw_30s_cleantags_50artists.tsv --stats-directory stats/raw_30s_cleantags_50artists
```

* `autotagging` file in `data` and folder in `stats` is a symbolic link to `raw_30s_cleantags_50artists`

* Visualize top 20 tags per category
```bash
python scripts/visualize_tags.py stats/autotagging 20  # generates top20.pdf figure
```

### Recreate subsets
* Create subset with only top50 tags by number of tracks
```bash
python scripts/filter_toptags.py data/autotagging.tsv 50 data/autotagging_top50tags.tsv --stats-directory stats/autotagging_top50tags --tag-list data/tags_top50.txt
python scripts/split_filter_subset.py data/splits autotagging autotagging_top50tags --subset-file data/tags_top50.txt
```

* Create subset with only mood/theme tags (or other category: genre, instrument)
```bash
python scripts/filter_category.py data/autotagging.tsv mood/theme data/autotagging_moodtheme.tsv
python scripts/split_filter_subset.py data/splits autotagging autotagging_moodtheme --category mood/theme
```
