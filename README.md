## Structure

### Metadata files in `data`

Pre-processing
- `raw.tsv` (56639) - raw file without postprocessing
- `raw_30s.tsv`(55701) - tracks with duration more than 30s
- `raw_30s_cleantags.tsv`(55701) - with tags merged according to `tag_map.json`
- `raw_30s_cleantags_50artists.tsv`(55609) - with tags that have at least 50 unique artists
- `tag_map.json` - map of tags that we merged
- `autotagging.tsv` = `raw_30sec_cleantags_50artists.tsv` - base file for autotagging (after all postprocessing)

Subsets
- `autotagging_top50tags.tsv` - only top 50 tags according to tag frequency in terms of tracks

Splits
- `splits` folder contains training/validation/testing sets for `autotagging.tsv`


### Statistics in `stats`

Statistics of number of tracks, albums and artists per tag sorted by artists
Each directory has statistics for metadata file with the same name

## Using the dataset

### Requirements

* Python 3.6
* Virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv`
* Create virtual environment and install requirements
```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

### Reproduce postprocessing & statistics

* Compute statistics
```bash
python scripts/statistics.py data/raw.tsv stats/raw
python scripts/statistics.py data/raw_30s.tsv stats/raw_30s
```

* Clean tags and recompute statistics
```bash
python scripts/clean_tags.py data/raw_30s.tsv data/tag_map.json data/raw_30s_cleantags.tsv
python scripts/statistics.py data/raw_30s_cleantags.tsv stats/raw_30s_cleantags
```

* Filter out tags with low number of unique artists and recompute statistics
```bash
python scripts/filter_fewartists.py data/raw_30s_cleantags.tsv 50 data/raw_30s_cleantags_50artists.tsv --stats-directory stats/raw_30s_cleantags_50artists
```

* `autotagging` file in `data` and folder in `stats` is a symbolic link to `raw_30s_cleantags_50artists`

* Visualize top 20 tags per category
```bash
python scripts/visualize_tags stats/autotagging 20  # generates top20.pdf figure
```

* Create subset with only top50 tags by number of tracks
```bash
python scripts/filter_toptags.py data/autotagging.tsv 50 data/autotagging_top50tags.tsv --stats-directory stats/autotagging_top50tags
```
